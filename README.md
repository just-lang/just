# Just
This is a base repository for the Just language

Just is a programming language that combines the best features of Julia and Rust. It is a minimalist language that supports multiple dispatch from Julia  and ownership dogma from Rust, while also incorporating the simplicity and ease of use of Julia. Just is a compiled language that is designed to be portable and embeddable, making it possible to develop Just programs that can run on a wide range of platforms, including embedded systems. With its strict ownership model and static typing, Just provides improved performance and reliability, making it well-suited for scientific and numerical computing as well as other applications.
