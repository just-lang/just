1. Define the syntax of the Just language in an abstract syntax tree (AST). The AST should include nodes for all of the language's constructs, including expressions, statements, functions, and types. Each node in the AST should have a type annotation.

2. Write a lexer and parser to convert Just source code into the AST. The lexer should convert the source code into a stream of tokens, and the parser should use the token stream to construct the AST.

3. Use the MLIR LLVM framework to define the Just-specific dialect of MLIR. This dialect should include the MLIR types and operations that correspond to the constructs defined in the Just AST.

4. Write a type checker to verify that the types in the AST are valid. This should ensure that expressions have the correct types, and that function arguments and return types match.

5. Write a code generator to convert the Just AST into LLVM IR using the MLIR LLVM framework. The code generator should traverse the AST, emitting LLVM IR for each node in the AST.

6. Use the LLVM IR optimizer to optimize the generated code, and then compile it to native machine code for the target platform.

7. Package the compiled code into an executable or library file that can be distributed to end-users.

8. Overall, building a Just compiler in Rust using the MLIR LLVM framework would involve implementing the various components needed to convert Just source code into native machine code. This would include a lexer and parser, an AST, a type checker, a code generator, and an optimizer. By using the MLIR LLVM framework, we can take advantage of the LLVM infrastructure to perform many of these tasks, while also benefiting from the performance and reliability of LLVM-generated code.
